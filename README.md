## About Me:
I was born in Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh (India) on July 1, 1995. My father is a businessman based 
out of Saharanpur and as per Indian culture my mother is a home maker and takes care of all our family affairs. I 
have one elder brother who is working as a Sr. Business Analyst at Nike, Taiwan. 

I completed my senior secondary school in 2014 and started my Bachelor of Technology from Raj Kumar Goel 
Institute of Technology, Ghaziabad, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering in 2014 and got graduated in 2018.
Along with academics, I took part in co-curricular and extra-curricular activities. I got inclined towards music in 
early 2011 and hence I took some guitar coaching and been playing it thereafter. I did play a major role in shaping up 
the Musical Rock Band of my college and emerged out as a performer during my graduation and won several inter-college musical events and some on National Level as well.
